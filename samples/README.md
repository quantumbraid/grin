# GRIN Sample Files

This directory contains reference `.grin` files for demos, validation checks,
and playback testing. Use `scripts/generate-samples.mjs` to regenerate them.

## Valid Samples

- `minimal.grin` — 1x1, group 0, unlocked, tickMicros 0, no rules.
- `minimal_locked.grin` — 1x1, group 0 locked, tickMicros 0, no rules.
- `pulse_red.grin` — 16x16, red pixels in group 0, PULSE rule (timing 0x27).
- `fade_gradient.grin` — 64x64 grayscale gradient, 4 groups, fade rules per band.
- `color_shift.grin` — 32x32 mid-gray, 3 groups, SHIFT_R/G/B with phase offsets.
- `groups_demo.grin` — 16x16 palette, each column is a distinct group.
- `locking_demo.grin` — 16x16, left half unlocked, right half locked, includes PULSE + LOCK/UNLOCK.
- `timing_demo.grin` — 16x16 quadrants, PULSE with square/triangle/sine/saw timings.
- `max_size.grin` — 512x512 RGB gradient, group 0, no rules.
- `max_rules.grin` — 16x16, 16 rules, all groups targeted, opcode set 0.
- `all_opcodes.grin` — 13x1, group per opcode, one rule per opcode (0x00-0x0C).

## Invalid Samples

- `invalid_magic.grin` — magic bytes changed to "NOPE".
- `invalid_header_size.grin` — HeaderSize set to 127.
- `truncated.grin` — file ends mid-pixel (header + 2 bytes).
- `invalid_opcode.grin` — rule uses opcode 0xFF.
