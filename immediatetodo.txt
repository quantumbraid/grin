# Immediate Documentation + Publishing Tasks

## Document Scan (Completed)
- [x] Scan `docs/` for TODO/TBD/FIXME markers (excluding generated `docs/api` output).
- [x] Confirm no actionable TODO markers were found in authored documentation.

## Required Follow-ups (Actionable)
- [ ] Review `docs/release-preparation.md` for accuracy before the next release cut.
- [ ] Validate Central Publisher Portal credentials and signing keys in a staging environment.
- [ ] Verify npm publish access for the `@grin-format/web` scope.

## Maven Central (Android) — User-Friendly Publishing Steps
1. **Prepare credentials**
   - Obtain Central Publisher Portal credentials for the GRIN organization.
   - Export environment variables:
     - `CENTRAL_USERNAME`
     - `CENTRAL_PASSWORD`
     - `SIGNING_KEY` (ASCII-armored PGP private key)
     - `SIGNING_PASSWORD`
2. **Verify Gradle config**
   - Ensure `android/lib/build.gradle.kts` contains the `maven-publish` and `signing` setup.
3. **Publish the release**
   - From `android/`, run:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew :lib:publish
     ```
4. **Release from staging**
   - Log in to the Central Publisher Portal and complete the deployment.
5. **Optional: JitPack**
   - Push a Git tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`) and verify the build at:
     `https://jitpack.io/#grin-format/grin`.

## npm dist (Web) — User-Friendly Publishing Steps
1. **Install dependencies**
   - From `web/`, run:
     ```bash
     npm ci
     ```
2. **Build distribution files**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - Confirm `web/dist/` is populated.
3. **Run tests**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
4. **Publish to npm**
   - Publish the scoped package:
     ```bash
     npm publish --access public
     ```

## Preflight Checklist (Both)
1. Confirm the tag version matches `android` + `web` package versions.
2. Validate Central Publisher Portal credentials are available.
3. Run `npm whoami` to confirm npm authentication.
